Just walked out of Mountainhead, and wow, my brain feels like someone threw a bucket of paint over a Jackson Pollock. What even... was that movie? It’s like they took all the inner monologues I've ever whispered to myself during a sleepless night and projected them onto a moving screen. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying it sucked. Far from it. But man, it’s like I’ve got the biggest theatrical whiplash.

So, picture this: a mountain, right? But not just any mountain. This thing is like some weird metaphorical beast that looms over everything, like your mom when you haven’t returned her Tupperware. The characters are all, like, climbing it or running from it or whatever. Honestly, I couldn’t tell halfway through. Maybe I was too busy trying to figure out why the colors felt like they were screaming at me. You ever seen a color scream? Me neither. Until now.

> This one dude, the main guy—let’s call him Beardy McIntense—he's got this whole existential crisis-guru vibe. Between trying to scale these metaphorical cliffs and confront some shadowy inner demons, I'm left wondering if he’s supposed to be me, you know? Like maybe I should start climbing mountains and resolving my daddy issues or something. But then he’s sweating buckets and I’m reminded of gym class. Hard pass, thanks.

About halfway through, there was this scene with a coffee cup—out of nowhere just like BAM—an espresso saves the day or whatever. The whole theater snorted in unison, promise. It was kinda genius, though. I mean, drinking coffee as a plot device? If real life worked that way, I’d be a hero by lunchtime.

The soundtrack was another thing. There’s this one track with violins squealing like angry cats in a thunderstorm—why? Who knows, but it worked. And by worked, I mean it left me feeling like I maybe should’ve leaned into the Tumblr-goth-aesthetic in my teens instead of whatever awkward phase I chose.

Would I download the movie or watch it again? Well, that's like asking if I'd order a durian pizza again. (The answer is maybe, but only because I’m still curious if my taste buds lied.) Mountainhead feels like one of those dreams where you wake up and think, huh, before rolling over and finding a more pleasant dream.

Anyway, if you're planning to see it, brace yourself. Maybe take a flashlight to find your own mountain in there. But hey, at least you won’t forget it soon. That’s something, right?
